SOURCE COMMING SOON.

This code was partially supported by the E2LP FP7-ICT EU Project at the Ruđer Bošković Institute Centre for Informatics and Computing, Zagreb, Croatia.

This implementation was inspired by, and heavily using, the Homebrew Cray 1a code by Christofer Fenton: https://www.chrisfenton.com/homebrew-cray-1a/

A "promotional" video about this implementation, "Reincarnation of Cray-1 on E2LP Platform" can be viewed at: http://gu.irb.hr/MIPRO2020/Reincarnation%20CRAY-1%20on%20E2LP%20Platform-720p.mp4
