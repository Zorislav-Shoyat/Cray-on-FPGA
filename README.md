This code was partially supported by the E2LP FP7-ICT EU Project at the Ruđer Bošković Institute Centre for Informatics and Computing, Zagreb, Croatia.

This implementation was inspired by, and heavily using, the Homebrew Cray 1a code by Christofer Fenton: https://www.chrisfenton.com/homebrew-cray-1a/

A "promotional" video about this implementation, "Reincarnation of Cray-1 on E2LP Platform" can be viewed at: http://gu.irb.hr/MIPRO2020/Reincarnation%20CRAY-1%20on%20E2LP%20Platform-720p.mp4

The used FPGA on E2LP board is Xilinx xc6sxl45-2fgg676. The Xilinx ise project file is in Cray_VI-2.002/Cray-VI/Cray-VI.xise

PS: The VI in Cray-VI is not the number 6, but the acronym for Virtue Infrastructure.
